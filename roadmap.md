## Roadmap

The CloudEvents Roadmap.

*Setup*

* Establish governance, contributing guidelines and initial stakeholders.
* Define design goals for CloudEvents V.1.
* Describe the scope of the specification.
* Draft educational materials that provide context for reading the spec.

*0.1*

* Draft specification that WG members agree *could* provide interoperability.
* Document at least 3 sample events that conform to the specification.
* Github repo is organized to be approachable to a engineers who might want to
implement the spec.
* Additional materials:
  * Use-cases.
  * Placeholder for protocol specification, folder and brief starter doc for
  HTTP.
* Finalize logo.
* Create and deploy a website that features a simple overview, email list and directs visitors to Github.
* Store all website assets in the CloudEvents repository, under the governance
of the working group.


*0.2*

* Create a reference implementation of at least two libraries or supporting
tools.
* Changes to the spec to facilitate adoption.
* HTTP protocol specification.
* Draft documentation and developer guide.
* Publicize at conferences ([CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/)).

*0.3*

* Interoperability demo.
  * At least one open source implementation of sending and receiving events.
  * Events are sent by code written by Developer1 and recieved by code written by Developer2, where Developer1 has no knowledge of Developer2.
  * Draft trigger specification (e.g. how events + actions are associated).
* Draft documentation and user guides.

*0.4*

* Incorporate learnings and feedback from interop demo to support wider adoption.
* Collaborate on libraries and supporting tools to use CloudEvents and
integrate it with the ecosystem.
