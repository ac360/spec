## Roadmap

The CloudEvents Roadmap.

*Setup*

* Establish governance, contributing guidelines and initial stakeholders.
* Define design goals for CloudEvents V.1
* Describe the scope of the specification
* Draft educational materials that provide context for reading the spec.

*0.1*

* Draft specification that WG members agree *could* provide interoperability
* Document at least 3 sample events that conform to the specification
* Github repo is organized to be approachable to a engineers who might want to
implement the spec
* Additional materials:
  * use-cases
  * placeholder for protocol specification, folder and brief starter doc for
  HTTP
* Finalize logo
* Deploy a website that features a simple overview, email list and directs 
visitors to Github


*0.2*

* reference implementation of at least two libraries or supporting tools
* changes to the spec to facilitate adoption
* HTTP protocol specification
* Draft documentation and developer guide.

*0.3*

* interop demo
  * at least one open source implementation of sending and receiving events
  * events are sent by code written by Developer1 and recieved by code written by Developer2, where Developer1 has no knowledge of Developer2
  * draft trigger specification (e.g. how events + actions are associated)
* Draft documentation and user guides.

*0.4*

* incorporate learnings and feedback from interop demo to support wider adoption
* Collaborate on libraries and supporting tools to use CloudEvents and
integrate it with the ecosystem.


Additional activities in parallel with above roadmap

* Create a page linking to implementations of the specification
* Participate in conferences (WG gatherings & presentations):
  * [CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/)
